Changing from WCUS to WCUR enables the dApp to reward an effort or activity or action rather than only shopping, for example students, developers, referrals, financial sponsors, as well as shoppers.

This is a blockchain based(Cardano) dApp for collecting loyalty shopping points world wide. The primary goal of this project is to make shopping profitable for consumers who are mainly women according to this research https://www.statista.com/statistics/311406/us-online-shopping-categories-gender/.

This project will be dedicated to Dr Lars Brunes' mother as WIMS honors women and would like to see all projects carrying women names.(Ref: https://wims.io/talk/2021/06/15/wims-cardano-galactic-voyages/)

Why Lars' mother has been chosen for patronaging this project? 

1) He travelled abroad and spent his time training women in IT(blockchain) in Ethopia(https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2019/04/04/training-blockchain-developers-in-africa/)
2) He is the teacher of Cardano Plutus Pioneers(https://pool.pm/addr1q9xfff9jfs0jxlhm3u7fg6q3xx455lp6pgy3sh9l5ar6p6w4j3yelwwvksulh77v2heqpyrzz37ekdze2tfxgxph8jcs4vrxqh)
3) Through his ingenuity and realization of this project we have hope in uplifting women world wide.

WIMS Cardano Universal Shopper is a consumer loyalty points dApp(blockchain - smart contract) which integrate all world existing cards/apps/programs shoppers are rewarded with. Please note the move from WIMS to WIMS Cardano is because we want all Cardano expert developers and resource issuers to take part and also ADA will be the unit of rewarding shoppers so that shopping rewards gain international value. This will make this project very interesting to companies and consumers. ADA has moved up to being the 5th ranked cryptocurrency(https://www.investopedia.com/news/introduction-cardano/)

Why Cardano not Bitcoin, not Ethereum, or other cryptos?

We have explored many blockchains(Dfinity, Polkadot, RSK, Cosmos, Ethereum...) none of them have EUTXO model which makes it possible to extend utility of blockchain beyond just finance. With the datum and redeemer features in transactions, many supporting dApps on this project will be possible. For example, we can attach email addresses to shopping transactions on blockchain and thus adding security to reward(shopping points) owners.(https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)

Transactions are fast and inexpensive, scallable and secure. This project will also benefit from lots of science, mathematical and financial research world wide. Everyone can relate to this project because everyone is a shopper: Developers, marketers, consultants, all industries, governments, urban dwellers, rural dwellers, developing worlds and developed world. We are all shoppers and we all can collaboratively make this happen and we can all be rewarded by this project.

Why WCUS?

According to Lindsey Peacock(2008),"Over the last decade, loyalty and customer rewards programs have proven they’re an effective way to drive customer retention, boost customer lifetime value, and inspire loyalty. While the low-key punch card has its place for some businesses, a truly innovative approach to customer loyalty programs can create huge value for retailers."(Source: https://www.shopify.com/blog/loyalty-program)

The world is alreading moving to blockchain for rewarding activities. WCUS will start with shopping, then later move to other areas like workforce: WCUW - WIMS Cardano Universal Worker(Workers earn ADA for their hardwork), to learning: WCUL - WIMS Cardano Universal Learner(students earn ADA for doing well), etc.

The Problem:

When people shop in stores they are given points via vendor specific shopping cards. Each company has its own card to promote its product/services.

a) Too many cards to carry

The proliferation of these means of retaining/rewarding customers/members leads to making consumers carrying many cards/join many programs. With WIMS Universal Shopper, consumers will not need to do that, only their mobile numbers will earn them rewards across all their shopping experiences locally and internationally.

b) Loss of rewards

Quite often consumers lose cards and consequently lose points/rewards. Forgetting the cards(or losing these cards) at home also leads to loss of points/rewards. WUS will stop these problems and consequently more women will benefit from accrued rewards stored permanently on blockchain.

Consumers must be able to get their shopping rewards with or without a card using their mobile phone numbers as the only needed Identifier.

c) New Companies will find it easy to introduce their rewards.

New companies thinking of creating new cards/rewards for new services/products can save funds by just registering with wims-universal-shopper.

d) Remote Women

Quite often women leaving in remote areas lack access to these rewards. WUS must be usable in areas like farms, villages, rural areas where there is no internet access. 

The dApp should work offline and sync with the blockchain when the user is where there is wifi or internet connection.

e) Save data

Many women have limit access to data or fast internet. The dApp must run on 2G/3G and work offline as well to help women use it with limited data.

d) Security

The dApp should be secure, simple, efficient and blend naturally with women's experiences.

e) Utility value of blockchain: one of the most difficult things with blockchains is that they are so abstract that they are not usable in our daily lives. This project is one of the few that will make ADA gain utility value.


Other Ways to Promote Women are listed below(WCUS - complements these):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Consumer

	"Study shows women drive between 70% and 80% of all consumer purchasing",(Source: https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/19/188975.html)

	Identify and promote activities which improve the life styles of women such as shopping, beauty
	- WIMS Universal Shopper(source: https://github.com/wimsio/wims-universal-shopper/edit/master/README.md)
	- WIMS blockchain based services/products etc
	
2. Business

	"Women in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain", (Source : https://www.bitira.com/women-in-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain/)
	- promote viable women based entrepreneurial ventures which marry traditional businesses with blockchain technologies

3. Education

	"TokenWoman",(Source: https://www.tokenwoman.io/#About)
	
    "10 May Half The Sky, Half the Wealth: How learning blockchain benefits girls",(Source: https://globalwomeninblockchain.org/half-the-sky-half-the-wealth-how-learning-blockchain-benefits-girls/)
	- blockchain RSK blockchain, coins RBTC, BTC, ETH, WIMT
	
4. Games 

	"Women Revolutionizing Blockchain: Cryptocurrencies for Change", (Source : https://www.cfr.org/event/women-revolutionizing-blockchain-cryptocurrencies-change-0)
	- competitions on creating rsk blockchain based games, services, dApps.
	
5. Entertainment

	- internet webTV(https://www.webtvsolutions.com/) and Radio broadcasting stations for on blockchain RSK
	
	"Blockchain seeks to continue this trend by creating a more direct relationship between creators and fans. ",
	(Source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/02/26/how-blockchain-will-transform-media--entertainment/#62010c5e1d1b)

6. Promote Women Empowerment Lobbyists Via Blockchain

	"the care work provided by women should be supported, while providing alternatives that empower women.",
	(Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13552074.2019.1634332)
	
But all the above lack one thing: They do not really touch what women world wide love most: shopping and shopping rewards.

I am looking for funding for this WIMS Cardano dApp. I am also looking for interested developers(and skilled people as well as investors) to partner and make this happen. Lastly I am looking for companies interested in partnering with WIMS on this or other projects.

If any project do not reward participants then people tend to ignore it now matter how beneficial or good it is.

This project directly rewards women(shoppers) world wide but for participants WIMS rewards are very unique: from honor, patronage, employment right to ROI.
